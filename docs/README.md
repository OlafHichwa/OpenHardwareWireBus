# Protocol Documentation | OHWB

In this directory you will find documentation describing the OHWB protocol.

Documentation is broken down into three sections:

- [Signaling](./signaling.md), which describes how encoded bits are transmitted over copper.
- [Data](./data.md), which describes how raw bytes are encoded into packets before transmission.
- and [Applications](./applications.md), which describes how different vendors can design encoding schemes to transmit different types of data.

These roughly correspond to levels 1, 2, and 6 of the OSI model respectively.
