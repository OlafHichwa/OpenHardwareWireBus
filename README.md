# Open Hardware Wire Bus

The Open Hardware Wire Bus (OHWB) is an open source high speed communication bus designed to transmit structured and unstructured data over twisted pairs. It is a point to point serial protocol with unidirectional or bidirectional modes.

This repository houses documentation for the protocol, as well as hardware and software implementations of the protocol for multiple platforms.

OHWB is desired as a learning and practice exercise by it's creators, and is still in the early stages of development.
